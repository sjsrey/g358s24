## Spatial Dependence

Working Concept

-   what happens at one place depends on events in nearby places

-   all things are related but nearby things are more related than
    distant things (Tobler)

-   central focus in [lattice data analysis]{.alert}

## Goodchild 1991

-   a world without positive spatial dependence would be an impossible
    world

-   impossible to describe

-   impossible to live in

-   [hell]{.alert} is a place with [no]{.alert} spatial dependence

## Spatial Dependence

Categorizing

-   Type: Substantive versus nuisance

-   Direction: Positive versus negative

Issues

-   Time versus space

-   Inference

## Substantive Spatial Dependence

Process Based

-   Part of the process under study

-   Leaving it out

    -   Incomplete understanding

    -   Biased inferences

## Nuisance Spatial Dependence

Not Process Based

-   Artifact of data collection

-   Process boundaries not matching data boundaries

-   Scattering across pixels

-   GIS induced

## Boundary

## Boundary Mismatch

![](figures/boundary2.png){width=".65\\linewidth"}

-   Even if $A$ and $B$ are independent

-   $A'$ and $B'$ will be dependent

## Nusiance vs. Substantive Dependence

Issues

-   Not always easy to differentiate from substantive

-   Different implications for each type

-   Specification strategies (Econometrics)

-   Both can be operating jointly

## Space versus Time

Temporal Dependence

-   Past influences the future

-   Recursive

-   One dimension

![](figures/timerecursive.png){width=".65\\linewidth"}

## Space versus Time

Spatial Dependence

-   Multi-directional

-   Simultaneous

## Terminology

Related Concepts

-   Spatial Dependence

-   Spatial Autocorrelation

-   Spatial Association

## Spatial Dependence

Distributional Characteristic

-   Multivariate density function

-   difficult/impossible to verify empirically

Dependent Distribution

-   does not factor in marginal densities

## Spatial Autocorrelation

-   Auto = same variable

-   Correlation = scaled covariance

-   Spatial - geographic pattern to the correlation

## Spatial Autocorrelation

Measurement of Moment of Distribution

-   off-diagonal elements of variance-covariance matrix

-   autocovariance

-   $C[y_i,y_j] \ne 0 \ \forall i\ne j$

-   can be estimated

Spatial Autocorrelation Coefficient

-   significance test on coefficient = 0

## Spatial Autocorrelation

Joint multivariate distribution function $$f(y) = \frac{ \exp\left[
-\frac{1}{2}
(y-\mu)'
\Sigma^{-1}
(y-\mu)
\right]} 
{\sqrt{(2\pi)^n|\Sigma|}}$$

## Variance-Covariance Matrix

$$\Sigma=
\left[
\begin{array}{rrrr}
\sigma_{1,1}&\sigma_{1,2}&\ldots&\sigma_{1,n}\\
\sigma_{2,1}&\sigma_{2,2}&\ldots&\sigma_{2,n}\\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
\sigma_{n,1}&\sigma_{n,2}&\ldots&\sigma_{n,n}
\end{array}
\right]$$

-   covariance: $\sigma_{i,j} = E[(y_i - \mu_i)(y_j-\mu_j)      ]$

-   symmetry: $\sigma_{i,j} =\sigma_{i,j}$

-   variance: $\sigma_{i,i} = E[(y_i - \mu_i)(y_i-\mu_i)      ]$

## Correlation

$$\rho_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{i}^2}\sqrt{\sigma_{j}^2}}$$
$$-1.0 \le \rho_{ij} \le 1.0$$

## Data Types and Autocorrelation

Point Data

-   focus on geometric pattern

-   random vs. nonrandom

-   clustered vs. uniform

Geostatistics

-   2-D modeling of spatial covariance (pairs of observations in
    function of distance)

-   kriging, spatial prediction

## Data Types and Autocorrelation

Lattice Data

-   areal units: states, counties, census tracts, watersheds

-   points: centroids of areal units

-   focus on the spatial nonrandomness of attribute values

## Spatial Association

Not a Rigorously Defined Term

-   Usually the same as spatial autocorrelation

-   often used in non-technical discussion

-   avoid unless meaning is clear

## Spatial Dependence

Good News (for geographers)

-   Space matters

-   Suggestive of underlying process

Bad news

-   invalidates random sampling assumption

-   necessitates new methods = spatial statistics and spatial
    econometrics

## Spatial Dependence: Implications

The specific process we are simulating is as follows:$$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:simdgp}y&=&X\beta + \epsilon \\ \nonumber\epsilon &=& \lambda W \epsilon + \nu  \end{aligned}$$
where $\nu^{\sim}N(0,\sigma^{2}I)$, $\lambda$ is a spatial
autocorrelation parameter (scalar) and $W$ is a spatial weights matrix.
If $\lambda=0$ then
the $i.i.d.$ assumption holds, otherwise there is spatial dependence.

$\beta=40, \ \sigma^2=16, \ x=[1,1,\ldots]$

$\lambda=[0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75], \ n=25$

## Spatial Dependence: Implications

For each D.G.P. we are going to generate 500 samples of size $n=25$ for
our map. You can think of this as generating 500 maps using the same
D.G.P.. For each sample we will then do the following:

1.  Estimate $\mu$ with $\bar{y}$

2.  Test the hypothesis that $\mu=40$

Null and Alternative Hypotheses
===============================

## Spatial Randomness

Null Hypothesis

-   observed spatial pattern of values is equally likely as any other
    spatial pattern

-   values at one location do no depend on values at other (neighboring)
    locations

-   under spatial randomness, the location of values may be altered
    without affecting the information content of the data

## Spatial Autocorrelation on a Grid

![Negative, Random, Positive](figures/patterns.png){width=".65\\linewidth"}

## Positive Spatial Autocorrelation

Clustering

-   like values tend to be in similar locations

Neighbor similarity

-   more alike than they would be under spatial randomness

Compatible with Diffusion

-   but not necessarily caused by diffusion

## Positive Spatial Autocorrelation

![](figures/positive.png){width=".65\\linewidth"}

## Negative Spatial Autocorrelation

Checkerboard pattern

-   anti-clustering

Neighbor dissimilarity

-   more dissimilar than they would be under spatial randomness

Compatible with Competition

-   but not necessarily caused by competition

## Negative Spatial Autocorrelation

![](figures/negative.png){width=".65\\linewidth"}

## Autocorrelation and Diffusion

One does not necessarily imply the other

-   diffusion tends to yield positive spatial autocorrelation but the
    reverse is not necessary

-   positive spatial correlation may be due to structural factors,
    without contagion or diffusion

## True vs. Apparent Contagion

What is the Cause behind the clustering?

-   True contagion

    -   result of a contagious process, social interaction, dynamic
        process

-   Apparent contagion

    -   spatial heterogeneity

    -   stratification

-   Cannot be distinguished in a pure cross section

-   Equifinality or Identification Problem

Spatial Autocorrelation Tests
=============================

## Clustering

Global characeristic

-   property of overall pattern = all observations

-   are like values more grouped in space than random

-   test by means of a global spatial autocorrelation statistic

-   no location of the clusters determined

## Clusters

Local characeristic

-   where are the like values more grouped in space than random?

-   property of local pattern = location-specific

-   test by means of a local spatial autocorrelation statistic

-   local clusters may be compatible with global spatial randomness

## Spatial Autocorrelation Statistic

Structure

-   Formal Test of Match between Value Similarity and Locational
    Similarity

-   Statistic Summarizes Both Aspects

-   Significance

    -   how likely is it (p-value) that the computed statistic would
        take this (extreme) value in a spatially random pattern

## Attribute Similarity

-   Summary of the similarity or dissimilarity of a variable at
    different locations

    -   variable $y$ at locations $i,j$ with $i\ne j$

-   Measures of similarity

    -   cross product: $y_i y_j$

-   Measures of dissimilarity

    -   squared differences: $(y_i - y_j)^2$

    -   absolute differences: $|y_i - y_j|$

## Locational Similarity

-   Formalizing the notion of Neighbor

    -   when two spatial units a-priori are likely to interact

-   Spatial Weights

    -   not necessarility geographical

    -   many approaches

## Summary

Spatial Dependence

-   Core of Lattice Analysis

-   Spatial Autocorrelation More Complex than Temporal Autocorrelation

-   Combine Value and Locational Similarities
