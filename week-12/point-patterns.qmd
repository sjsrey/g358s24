# Objectives of Point Pattern Analysis

## Point Pattern Analysis Objectives

### Goals

-   Pattern detection
-   Assessing the presence of *clustering*
-   Identification of individual *clusters*

### General Approaches

-   Estimate intensity of the process
-   Formulating an idealized model and investigating deviations from expectations
-   Formulating a stochastic model and fitting it to the data


## Point Pattern Analysis Definitions

Spatial Point Pattern: A set of events, irregularly distributed within a
region $A$ and presumed to have been generated by some form of
stochastic mechanism.

Representation $\left\{Y(A),
    A \subset \Re \right\}$, where $Y(A)$ is the number of events
occurring in area $A$.

### Events, points, locations

Event

:   an occurrence of interest

Point

:   any location in study area

Event location

:   a particular point where an event occurs





## Point Pattern Analysis Definitions

Region: $A$

-   Most often planar (two-dimensional Euclidean space)
-   One dimensional applications also possible
-   Three-dimensional increasingly popular (space + time)
-   Point processes on networks (non-planar)

## Point Patterns

### Unmarked Point Patterns

-   Only location is recorded

-   Attribute is binary (presence, absence)

### Marked Point Patterns

-   Location is recorded

-   Non-binary stochastic attribute

-   e.g., sales at a retail store, dbh of tree


## Realizations

### Mapped Point Patterns

-   *All* events are recorded and mapped

-   Complete enumeration of events

-   Full information on the realization from the process

### Sampled Point Patterns

-   *Sample* of events are recorded and mapped

-   Complete enumeration of events impossible or intractable

-   Partial information on the realization from the process

-   Presence/"absence" data (ecology, forestry)

# Research Questions

## Research Questions

- Location Only are points randomly located or patterned

- Location and Value

	-   marked point pattern
	-   is combination of location and value random or patterned

Both Cases: What is the Underlying Process?


## Points on a Plane (Planar Point Pattern Anaysis)

### Classic Point Pattern Analysis

-   points on an isotropic plane
-   no effect of translation and rotation
-   classic examples: tree seedlings, rocks, etc

### Distance
-   no directional effects
-   no translational effects
-   straight line distance only

## Intensity

### First Moment

-   number of points $N$, area of study $|A|$
-   intensity: $\lambda = N/|A|$
-   area depends on bounds, often arbitrary

### Artificial Boundaries

-   bounding box (rectangle, square)
-   other (city boundary)



## Bounding Box

## District Boundary

## Convex Hull

- Tightest fit various algorithms

- Rescaled Convex Hull (Ripley-Rasson)

	-   adjust to properly reflect spatial domain of point process
	-   use centroid of convex hull
	-   rescale by $1/[\sqrt{(1-m/N)}]$
	-   $m$: number of vertices of convex hull
